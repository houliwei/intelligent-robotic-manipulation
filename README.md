First , you should have a hardware platform . [Here](https://github.com/houliwei/intelligent-robotic-manipulation/tree/master/robots) are the platforms I mainly use. 

Secend , **compliance** is a necessary component for maniplulation , the implementation of compliace controller is [Here](https://github.com/houliwei/intelligent-robotic-manipulation/tree/master/Compliant-Control)

Next , we are going to explore the amazing world of manipulation. 

This repository will focus on the learning-based manipulation , specifically speaking, deep reinforcement learning-based manipulation.

To quickly grasp the research progress in this field, you can read some [reviews](https://github.com/houliwei/intelligent-robotic-manipulation/tree/master/reviews) first
